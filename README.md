# DataWise Automation â€“ Core Bash Scripting Concepts

This script is designed to automate AWS operations such as launching EC2 instances and creating S3 buckets using essential Bash scripting concepts.

---

##  Functions
Functions allow us to organize and reuse blocks of code for specific tasks. They break the script into manageable units such as launching EC2 instances or creating S3 buckets.

- Improve script readability and maintainability  
- Simplify debugging  
- Promote code reuse  

---

##  Arrays
Arrays are used for storing a collection of values (elements) in a single variable.

- Useful for managing multiple related items (e.g., instance IDs, bucket names, instance types)  
- Allow easy iteration through values using loops  
- Automate batch operations efficiently  

---

##  Environment Variables
Environment variables are used to store configuration values such as AWS credentials, regions, instance types, etc.

- Enhance security by avoiding hardcoded sensitive data  
- Make scripts portable and reusable in different environments  
- Simplify updates to configuration values  

---

##  Command Line Arguments
Command line arguments allow users to pass values to the script when executing it.

- Enable dynamic and flexible script execution  
- Avoid hardcoding values directly in the script  
- Users can specify instance types, bucket names, and other parameters during runtime  

---

##  Error Handling
Error handling detects and responds to issues during script execution.

- Prevents the script from crashing unexpectedly  
- Provides meaningful error messages or logs  
- Handles AWS failures like permission errors, invalid input, or network issues gracefully

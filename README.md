## **4. Methodology**

This project follows a structured step-by-step approach:

### **4.1 Version Control with Git**

1. **Create a Local Repository**
2. **Download a Website Template**
3. **Stage and Commit the Website Files**
4. **Push Code to a Remote Git Repository**

### **4.2 AWS Deployment**

1. **Set Up an AWS EC2 Instance**
2. **Connect to the Instance via SSH**
3. **Clone Git Repository on the AWS Server**
4. **Install and Configure Apache Web Server**

### **4.3 Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**

1. **Create a Development Branch and Make Changes**
2. **Commit and Push the Changes**
3. **Merge Changes into the Main Branch**
4. **Pull Updates on the AWS Server**
5. **Restart Apache Server to Apply Changes**
